Minimac3 Changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 2.0.1
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : June 6, 2016

	Major Changes:
	1. Reduced memory usage significantly (by 35% for HRC panel)
	2. Reduced run time significantly (by 20% for HRC panel)
	3. Added a --lowMemory version that further reduces the memory usage
	   furhter by 33% (but takes 10% more time.
	
	Minor Changes:
	1. Fixed a minor bug in parameter estimation (--processReference)
	2. Added a draft.m3vcf file output after file compression and
	   before parameter estimation.
	3. Changed definition of Estimated R-square so that no estimates
	   are over 1.0.
	   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 1.0.14
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : April 15, 2016

	Fixed a bug in the makefile that was missing the g++ -O4
	optimization flag. As a result, the openmp version was 
	3-4 times slower than expected. Updated LibStatGen Library
	files to remove some warnings/errors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 1.0.13
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : October 15, 2015

        Updated the format of info file to report only REF and ALT 
        alleles instead of Major and Minor allele. The ALT_Frq and
        MAF can be compared to find minor allele. The usual .dose
        and .hapDose file have been updated to report alternate al-
        -llele dosage and NOT major allele dosage, like earlier ve-
        -rsions of minimac. Also mended a bug related to variants
        that were typed only, while using --allTypedVariants option.
        Finally, added acknowledgements to David Hinds, for his
        immense help in making the code faster.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 1.0.12
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : September 5, 2015

        Added --allTypedVariants option which adds variants which were
	typed ONLY to the imputed output files and imputes any missing
	values in such variants to the MAF. Also fixed a bug with chr-
	-omosome X only male samples.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 1.0.11
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : April 21, 2015

        Implemented parallel threading for processReference. Moved all
	haplotype data from char vector to bool vector. Implemented
	David's patch and similar other division-removal techniques.
	Also added legacy parameter unphased for unphased output.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 1.0.10
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : February 27, 2015

        Add parameter --log which will output a log file (BUT not print 
        on the screen). Also added legacy parameter --myChromosome whi-
        will enable users to use special chromosomes (apart from 1-22 
        and X)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 1.0.8, 1.0.9
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : February 20, 2015

        Removed dependcies on boost directory. Converted all double to fl-
        oat. Had to change the main imputation formula to work well for l-
        arge values. Also updated Rsq calulation formual to avoid underfl-
        as a result of using float. Made minor changes to memory allocati-
        on so as to remove all 2-d or 3-d look-ups. Updated a loop to rem-
        ove repeat allocation, similar to minimac2. Now it is faster and 
        uses much lesser memory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 1.0.7
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : January 31, 2015

        Fixed minor bugs and made thigsn ready for final release !!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 1.0.6
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : November 4, 2014

        Mended some minor bugs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 1.0.5
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : October 3, 2014

        Implemented chromosome X imputation (both PAR and non-PAR). Also
	added bgzip option to enable tabix options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 1.0.4
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : September 19, 2014

        Improved the chuking option for the compressed files. Updated name
	OPTM to M3VCF (Minimac3 VCF). Changed handle to --processReference.
	Added the option to add parameter estimates within M3VCF files wh-
	-ich can be used for later runs. Added a new handle --updateModel
	that will allow users to update these estimates using the target
	panel as well, if and when they think necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 1.0.2
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : August 28, 2014

        Mended a bug related to --vcfoutput option when used with --gzip 
	option. Also added a option --format to manage handles in the
	FORMAT field for output VCF files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 1.0.1
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : August 6, 2014

        Added the --window option that will allow a buffer region around
	chunks. Also implemented this --start, --end and --window option
	on OPTM files. Minimac3 will, thus, be able to handle chunks on 
	OPTM files as well. However, it will not perform the optimal all-
	-ocation again but just extract the chunk from the given file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 1.0.0
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : July 21, 2014

        Added the --vcfOutput option that will output the dosage in VCF
	format as well. Improved it by allowing to flush out VCF files
	after every 200 samples to save memory. Also implemented openmp
	to allow parallel computing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 0.7.1
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : June 8, 2014

        Added the --golden option that can calculate the actual R-square
	if the true/hard genotypes are provided in a vcf file. Made minor 
	editions for debugging.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 0.6.2
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : June 8, 2014

        Edited bug in VCF packing part that was giving slightly less opt-
	mized configurations. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version : 0.6.1
Author  : Sayantan Das
Date    : June 7, 2014

        Worked on an important bug that gave memory overflow in large sa-
	mples. Name changed to Minimac3. Added utility for VCF output fo-
	rmat that would enable users to easy data manipulation. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version	: 0.5.1
Author	: Sayantan Das
Date	: April 9, 2014

    	Removed futher bugs. Modified to use lesser memory and run faster.
	The Unique.cpp file was updated according to Goncalo's packVcf so-
	ftware. Target Data is being read more effeciently. Scaffolding
	done locally during imputation. Changed name to Minimac2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version	: 0.4.1
Author	: Sayantan Das
Date	: March 14 2014 

    	Removed bug with --sample. Added lots of other options like --chr,
	--start, --end, --rounds, --states etc. Added data structure for 
	variant type. Added structure so as NOT to use haplotype data after 
	reading it once. Now the code uses the reduced haplotype structure
	once it has read the data. This was uses lesser memory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version	: 0.2.1
Author	: Sayantan Das
Date	: January 29 2014

	Improved on the speed in parameter estimation part by NOT calcula-
	ting the optimal allocation everytime, instead update it from the
	original allocation. Updated to use --refSnps for reference, use
	--vcfTarget for target files.
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version	: 0.1.1
Author	: Sayantan Das
Date	: May 25 2013

    	Started working on the basis of code of minimac. Implemented State
	Space Reduction Method for HMM calculations. Implemented the Para-
	meter Estimation part and Optimal Allocation part.
